"""
This app creates a simple sidebar layout using inline style arguments and the
dbc.Nav component.

dcc.Location is used to track the current location. There are two callbacks,
one uses the current location to render the appropriate page content, the other
uses the current location to toggle the "active" properties of the navigation
links.

For more details on building multi-page Dash applications, check out the Dash
documentation: https://dash.plot.ly/urls
